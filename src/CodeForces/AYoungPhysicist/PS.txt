@Inputs
The first line contains a positive integer n (1≤n≤100),
 then follow n lines containing three integers each:
  the xi coordinate, the yi coordinate and the zi coordinate of the force vector,
   applied to the body (-100 ≤xi,yi,zi≤ 100).

@Outputs
Print the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not.

#Constraints
- time limit per test2: seconds
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
- initiate 3 variables (x,y,z)<short>
- loop over n<byte> lines (each line has 3 values) sum first to x, second to y, third to z.
- if x, y and z are all equals zero then it's "YES", else it's "NO"
