Input:
-The first line contains two integers n and t (1≤n,t≤50), which represent the number of children
 in the queue and the time after which the queue will transform into the arrangement
  you need to find.

-The next line contains string s, which represents the schoolchildren's initial arrangement.
 If the i-th position in the queue contains a boy,
  then the i-th character of string s equals "B", otherwise the i-th character equals "G".

Output:
Print string a, which describes the arrangement after t seconds.
 If the i-th position has a boy after the needed time, then the i-th character a must equal "B",
  otherwise it must equal "G".
