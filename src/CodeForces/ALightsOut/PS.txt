@Inputs
-The input consists of three rows. Each row contains three integers each between
 0 to 100 inclusive. The j-th number in the i-th row is the number of times the j-th light
  of the i-th row of the grid is pressed.

@Outputs
Print three lines, each containing three characters. The j-th character of the i-th line
 is "1" if and only if the corresponding light is switched on, otherwise it's "0".

#Constraints
- time limit per test2: seconds
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
- we have a matrix 3X3 while all the values are 1.
- if the number of times a switch is pressed is odd then it's 0 (light out).
- create a helper function to find adjacent cells.
   /adjacent cells are those who share either the same row or the same column.
   /x and y must be in bounds >= 0 && <= 2;
   /(x-y) must be <= 1
- loop over the matrix and match the cells with their adjacent cells.
