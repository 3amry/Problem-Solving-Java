@Inputs
The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers:
 the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is
  located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column.
   It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

@Outputs
Print a single integer â€” the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

#Constraints
- time limit per test2: seconds
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
- initiate a matrix with 5 rows and 5 columns all set to zero. (optional)
- loop over the inputs and assign each value to it's corresponding place in the matrix. (optional)
- once you find the odd number (1) calculate the moves and return it.
   using formula i / 5 for moves in rows,
    and i % 5 (remainder) for moves in columns.
