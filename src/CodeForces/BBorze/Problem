Ternary numeric notation is quite popular in Berland.
 To telegraph the ternary number the Borze alphabet is used.
  Digit 0 is transmitted as «.», 1 as «-.» and 2 as «--».
   You are to decode the Borze code, i.e.
    to find out the ternary number given its representation in Borze alphabet

Input:
The first line contains a number in Borze code.
 The length of the string is between 1 and 200 characters.
  It's guaranteed that the given string is a valid Borze code of some ternary number
   (this number can have leading zeroes).

Output:
Output the decoded ternary number. It can have leading zeroes

Example 1:
 Input:
 .-.--
 Output:
 012

Example 2:
 Input:
 --.
 Output:
 20

Example 3:
 Input:
 -..-.--
 Output:
 1012

Constraints:
- time limit per test2: seconds
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
