@Inputs
The first line contains a number in Borze code.
 The length of the string is between 1 and 200 characters.
  It's guaranteed that the given string is a valid Borze code of some ternary number
   (this number can have leading zeroes).

@Outputs
Output the decoded ternary number. It can have leading zeroes

#Constraints
- time limit per test2: seconds
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
- use a string builder to store the decoded number and concatenate to it.
- use a for loop to check:
    if it's a '.' then push a '0'
    if it's a '-' followed by a '.' push a '1' and increment loop counter
    else push a '2' and increment loop counter
