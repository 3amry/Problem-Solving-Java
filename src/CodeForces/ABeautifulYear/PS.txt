@Inputs
-The single line contains integer y (1000≤y≤9000) — the year number.

@Outputs
Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y
 and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

#Constraints
- time limit per test2: seconds
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
#First is to know if it's distinct (boolean function).
- create a hashset to store distinct digits.
- use the remainder to extract digits.
- add each digit to the set
 (if it returns false?) then it's not distinct.
 if set size == input integer length then it's distinct.
#Second integer++ till you find the next beautiful year (returns int).
