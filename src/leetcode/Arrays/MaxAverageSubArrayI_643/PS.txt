@Inputs
integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

@Outputs
double

#Constraints
    n == nums.length
    1 <= k <= n <= 105
    -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
main idea here is to add kth elements storing it into max variable
 then for each more element we add
  we subtract the first element from sum as well, so that it's always sum of kth elements
   then max = Math.max(old sum, new sum) as we iterate.

one way is to use a sliding window technique (which is better)
similar approach is using cumulative sum array approach
