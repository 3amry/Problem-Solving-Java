#Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
- we need two loops first one: for the whole array, second one: is to find LHS for that number.
- for every number we hold two counts for both positive and negative one, both counts get reset every loop.
- we hold a global maxCount Or LHS.
