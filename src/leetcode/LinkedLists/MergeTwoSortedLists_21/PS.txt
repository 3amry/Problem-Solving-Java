@Inputs
two sorted linked lists

@Outputs
one sorted linked list

#Constraints
    The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
1- make a new list
2- check if l1.next <= l2.next
3- add each node to the new sorted list dependently on the result
-- we could decrease space complexity and accessibility dependencies by
 choosing (l1 or l2) to be our combined sorted list instead of making a new one.
