@Inputs
sorted linked list

@Outputs
sorted linked list without duplicates.

#Constraints
    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
because the list is sorted we could iterate over the list and if the value is equal to previous we skip it.
