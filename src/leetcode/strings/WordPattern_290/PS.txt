two strings (a pattern and a string s).

@Outputs
boolean

#Constraints
    1 <= pattern.length <= 300
    pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
    1 <= s.length <= 3000
    s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
    s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
    All the words in s are separated by a single space.

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
1- separate every word in s
2- map every letter in pattern to a corresponding word in s (only if key doesn't exist).
3- check if the key already exists and compare it with the corresponding word.
