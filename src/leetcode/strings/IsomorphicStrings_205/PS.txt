@Inputs
two strings [s and t]

@Outputs
boolean

#Constraints
    1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    t.length == s.length
    s and t consist of any valid ascii character.


---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
-every letter has a print we can map it with its index to the number of its occurrences.
  so that if swapped the letter with another it should have the same print.

-another solution is to map every letter to the index of its last appearance, and
  it has to match with the adjacent letter in the other string.
