@Inputs
two binary strings

@Outputs
sum as binary string

#Constraints
    1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
    a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
    Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
1+1=0 with carry 1
0+0=0 with carry 0
1+0=1 with carry 0
0+1=1 with carry 0
Imp:1+1=1 with carry 1 if previous carry was 1.
The carry gets added in next step(scanning from right to left).
