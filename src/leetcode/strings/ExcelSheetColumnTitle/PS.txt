@Inputs
Int (column number)

@Outputs
String (column title)

#Constraints
    1 <= columnNumber <= 2^31 - 1

---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
Main calculation is input/26
-get the remainder to get the nth title
_special case is when remainder = 0 (then it's 'Z' and nth--)
-get the quotient to get the nth nth title
_special case when quotient is more than 26 then repeat what we just did above

-support function intToChar {
 add 64(ASCII Uppercase) to int
 then cast it to char

            OR {char = '@' + int}
}
