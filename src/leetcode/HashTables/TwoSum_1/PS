@Inputs
array of integers nums and an integer target.

@Outputs
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#Constraints
    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.
---------------------------------------------
@Pseudo-Code.
add the complement (to be equal to target) to a hash table as a key with its value as the [index of] number.
